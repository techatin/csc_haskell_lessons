#HSLIDE

# Variables
Remember in python, this is what happens...

```python
x = 3
x = 4
x = "I don't care what you do here."
```
But haskell is pure!!!

#VSLIDE

### Purity
In haskell, variables are merely &#39;nicknames&#39; of values. Furthermore, you can&#39;t just give the nickname to someone else. In other words, there cannot be any &#39;side effects&#39; to anything you do.

```haskell
x :: Int
x = 3
x = 4 -- Error! Redefinition
```
In other words, the `=` sign in haskell works like your mathematical definition - once it is defined, you cannot change it.

#HSLIDE

# Types
In python, we have `int`, `str`, and `char` data types. It is the same in haskell, except that there are more and they appear in different names

#VSLIDE

### `Int`
The type `Int` is like the python data type `int`, since they both hold integer values. The difference that the python `int` can hold up to some pretty large values, while this is not the case for haskell. In haskell, `Int` only stores machine sized integers. That is, somewhere near $(\pm 2^{63} )$ depending on your machine. To find the exact size, you can do this:

```haskell
biggestInt, smallestInt :: Int
biggestInt  = maxBound
smallestInt = minBound
```
#VSLIDE

### `Double`
There is nothing to interesting about `Double`. It is just like the python `float`.

```haskell
d1, d2 :: Double
d1 = 3.14159
d2 = 6.02e23 -- yes, you can use scientific notation
```
#VSLIDE

### `Char`
A `Char` data type holds a unicode character

```haskell
c1, c2 :: Char
c1 = 'x'
c2 = 'Ã˜' -- Yes, non ascii also!!
```
Note that a `Char` value must be surrounded with a pair of single quotes.

#VSLIDE

### `Bool`
A `Bool` data type holds a boolean value(True or False)

```haskell
b1, b2 :: Bool
b1 = True
b2 = False -- Just your plain old stuff
```
#VSLIDE

### `String`
Strings are just list of characters(we will cover lists later)

```haskell
s :: String
s = "Hello, Haskell!"
```
Note that a `String` values must be surrounded by a pair of double quotes.

#HSLIDE

# Operations
But what can we do on these data types?

#VSLIDE

### Arithmetics
You can perform your beloved arithmetics with `Int`, `Integer` and `Double`.

```haskell
ex01 = 3 + 2
ex02 = 19 - 27
ex03 = 2.35 * 8.6
ex04 = 8.7 / 3.1
ex05 = mod 19 3
ex06 = 19 `mod` 3
ex07 = 7 ^ 222
ex08 = (-3) * (-7)
```
Notice something in ex06? The function `mod` is called with the backticks. This is what we call the infix notation. In general, `f a b` is equivalent to this expression: <code> a &#96;f&#96; b</code>

#VSLIDE

### Arithmetics
But what if you tried this?

```haskell
badArith1 = 1 + 0.1
badArith2 = 1 / 1
```
It turns out that both will result in a syntax error. This is because of the fact that the arithmetic operators can only operate on values of the same time, but you are trying to add a `Int` to a `Double`. The second one will also cause an error because you are trying two `/` two `Int`s, while `/` is only defined for `Double`. To perform `Int` division, you can do this: <code>a &#96;div&#96; b</code>.

#VSLIDE

### Logic
Nothing is ever complete with the good old logical operators. In haskell, you can manipulate boolean values in the following way:

```haskell
ex11 = True && False -- && means 'and'
ex12 = not (False || True) -- || means 'or'
```
Note that you do not have to put the backticks around `and` because it is defined to be an infix operator. We will cover more on that later. Of course, you can do other things that gives you a boolean result:

```haskell
ex13 = ('a' == 'a') -- (==) tests for equality
ex14 = (16 /= 3) -- (/=) tests for inequality
ex15 = (5 > 3) && ('p' <= 'q')
ex16 = "Haskell" > "C++"
```
You can also do if statements, though it is not very recommended:

```haskell
ex17 = if "Haskell" > "C++" then "Hooray" else "Nooooo"
-- basically: if <cond> then <expr1> else <expr2>
```
#HSLIDE

# Functions!!!
Haskell is FUNCTIONal, so function does play a big part in the language.

#VSLIDE

### A Tiny Peek
Here is a very simple function that computes the factorial of an integer:

```haskell
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```
This may not make sense to you yet, so let&#39;s look at it carefully. The first line says that the function maps an `Integer` to another `Integer`. The second line says if the input is a `0`, the return value if `1`. The last line says for any other integers, the return value is the integer `n` multiplied by the factorial of `n - 1`.

For one thing, that looks like math!!!

#VSLIDE

### Well, yes, that&#39;s true.
Haskell functions are indeed like mathematical functions in the sense that they just map one value to another, and we can define them recursively like what I&#39;ve done above. Besides specifying different rules for different values, we can also use a `guard`:

```haskell
hailstone :: Integer -> Integer
hailstone n
  | n `mod` 2 == 0  = n `div` 2
  | otherwise       = 3 * n + 1
```
This looks like the piecewise function mentioned in the H2 Math tutorial. Remember?

#VSLIDE

### What&#39;s that weird line?
In the previous examples, we always write something like `function1 :: a -&gt; b` before the actual definition of the function. This is the `type` of functions, which specify what types it accepts as input, and what type its output is.

#VSLIDE

### There&#39;s more...
What if you want more than one argument to the function? Of course you can pass in a pair, or a triplet, but here is an easier way:

```haskell
sumThree :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Integer
sumThree x y z = x + y + z
```
which basically says the function takes in three `Integer`s and return another one. For now, just remember that the type signature goes like:

```haskell
function1 :: t1 -> t2 -> t3 -> ... -> tn -> tr
```
where $(t_1)$ to $(t_n)$ are types of the inputs, and $(t_r)$ is the type of the output.

#HSLIDE

# Pairs
a.k.a. ships, or couples

#VSLIDE

### How they work
We can pair two values up using the pair constructor. It looks something like:

```haskell
p :: (Int, Char)
p = (3, 'x')
```
You know what&#39;s better? Its value can be extracted using *pattern matching*:

```haskell
sumPair :: (Int,Int) -> Int
sumPair (x,y) = x + y
```
#HSLIDE

# Lists
The standard stuff

#VSLIDE

### Examples
```haskell
nums, range, range2 :: [Integer]
nums   = [1,2,3,19]
range  = [1..100]
range2 = [2,4..100]
```
Haskell (like Python) also has list comprehensions; you can read about them [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out)

#VSLIDE

### Strings
Strings are just lists of characters!!!

```haskell
-- hello1 and hello2 are exactly the same.

hello1 :: [Char]
hello1 = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

hello2 :: String
hello2 = "hello"

helloSame = hello1 == hello2 -- True
```
#VSLIDE

### Constructing Lists
The simplest list is the empty list:

```haskell
emptyList = []
```
Other lists are built up from the empty list using the `cons` operator, `(:)`. Cons takes an element and a list, and produces a new list with the element prepended to the front.

```haskell
ex18 = 1 : []
ex19 = 3 : (1 : [])
ex20 = 2 : 3 : 4 : []
ex21 = [2,3,4] == 2 : 3 : 4 : []
```
#VSLIDE

### Functions on Lists
We can apply pattern matching on lists too!

```haskell
-- Compute the length of a list of Integers.
intListLength :: [Integer] -> Integer
intListLength []     = 0
intListLength (x:xs) = 1 + intListLength xs
```
The first part says that the length of an empty list is zero. The second part says that if the input list looks like `(x:xs)`, that is, a first element `x` `cons`ed onto a remaining list `xs`, then the length is one more than the length of `xs`.
