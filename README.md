# A Gentle Introduction to Haskell for CSC Members
------------------

### What is this for?

Haskell - functional, pure and notorious. It is so beautiful, so complex, so intriguing, and yet so hard to learn.

Hopefully, this set of slides can take you through the process of learning haskell, and hence introduce you to the wonderful world of functional programming.

### So what is haskell?

This should have been covered in the lesson slides. In case you are some outsider - don't be lazy. Go google.

### Why should I learn haskell?

To get your brain fried. Seriously, if you are looking for some mental stimulation and break from the boring, tedious world of normal programming, then haskell is for you.

### Other frequently asked questions

> What if I don't understand x? where x = monad, functors, monoid etc

It is normal. Try doing the exercises, and if you really cannot do them, read through the slides again. If you still cannot understand it, don't think about it for a week and come back a while later.

> Why do you use this site for the slides instead of, say, Google Presentation?

Because it is annoying to write code in Google Presentation. Also, powerpoint does not really work for this. Trust me.
